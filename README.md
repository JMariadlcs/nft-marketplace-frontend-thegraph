# NFT MARKETPLACE FRONTEND MORALIS 🦄

This is a one of the two Frontend implementation of a NFT Marketplace from Patrick Alpha's fcc. The backend repo can be found [here](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/nft-marketplace-backend).

The frontend of this project is being implemented in two different ways:

1. Using [Moralis Indexer Frontend](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/nft-marketplace-frontend-moralis).
2. Using [TheGraph Indexer](https://github.com/JMariadlcs/nft-marketplace-frontend-thegraph).

The workshop followed to complete this repo is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ&t=15996s).

The repo that we are going to implement is like [this one](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/nextjs-nft-marketplace-thegraph-fcc) and [this one](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/graph-nft-marketplace-fcc).
